# stacking

This repo has code for block stacking tasks such as tallest tower, longest overhang, etc. using a robot manipulator. This includes:

* A simulation-based particle filter to estimate the center of mass of blocks.
* An active learning strategy to learn a model for abstract plan feasibility with a information-theoretic approach to improve data sampling efficiency.
* (IN PROGRESS) A learning approach to estimate task-specific block properties using a learned latent representation.

All robot experiments (simulation and real-world) are conducted using a Franka Emika Panda robot.
