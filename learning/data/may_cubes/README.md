# May Cubes

Data to be used in repeatable active learning experiments.

## Blocks

Block sets are all cubes, and were generated by

```
set_a = [Object.random(f"obj_{i}", dim_range=(0.7,0.7)) for i in range(10)] 
set_b = [Object.random(f"obj_{i}", dim_range=(0.7,0.7)) for i in range(10)] 
set_c = [Object.random(f"obj_{i}", dim_range=(0.7,0.7)) for i in range(10)] 
```

## Towers


Sequential towers were generated by 

```
python -m learning.domains.towers.generate_sequential_dataset --block-set="learning/data/may_cubes/blocks/set_a.npy" --num-towers=1000 --suffix=seq_a_1
```
